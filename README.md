# Daimler Trucks North America

The trucking industry in USA is massive. Drivers typically don't own their trucks, and are paid for every trip, irrespective of their cost they incur and the time it takes them to complete the trip.

So what happens when their trucks break down? They take longer to complete the trip without being compensated for the extra time they spend. Trucks are extremely complex, and repairing them is a complicated, specialised process. So it's in everyone's interest in reducing a truck's downtime.

Daimler trucks, one of USA's largest truck manufacturer's took it upon themselves to hunt for quicker solutions to diagnose the cause for a breakdown and repair it. Our solution does precisely this, helping all stakeholders of the ecosystem!
